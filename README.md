Pathfinding or pathing is the plotting, by a computer application, of the shortest route between two points. 
It is a more practical variant on solving mazes. This field of research is based heavily on Dijkstra's algorithm for 
finding the shortest path on a weighted graph.

Pathfinding is closely related to the shortest path problem, within graph theory, which examines how to identify the path that
best meets some criteria (shortest, cheapest, fastest, etc) between two points in a large network.
